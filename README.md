1. Using '*f_Web_scrap.py*' and the search terms described in the methods, we retrieved peer-reviewed articles from scientific literature databases (PubMed and Google Scholar). We complemented this search with a reference list search of studies published up to July 30th, 2023.

2. We screened and selected studies (see Methods) and extracted data on an excel sheet (please contact [Léa Fourchault](mailto:lfourchault@naturalsciences.be) <lfourchault@naturalsciences.be> for access to the raw data).

3. We attributed a risk score to each practice recorded on the excel sheet using '*f_Data_transformation.py*' and categories described in the Methods.

4. We conducted the analysis on the resulting dataset using ‘*Metadata_health_simplified.R*’ and ‘*Main_health_simplified.R*’ contains code for supporting elements.
